It's day 86 of my **#100DaysOfDevOps** challenge, in this blog I'll be writing about what I learned today =&gt; The benefits and challenges of splitting the monolith into microservices...

In the software development world, a monolith refers to a single, unified application that handles all the functionalities of an application, **monolithic architecture** has been the go-to approach for building complex applications for a long time. But as applications become more complex and larger, the monolithic architecture can become challenging to maintain and scale. This is where the concept of microservices comes in.

# What are Microservices?

Microservices is a software development approach where an application is split into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each microservice has its own codebase, and data storage, and is responsible for specific functionality of the application. In this blog, I'll discuss the benefits and challenges of splitting the monolith into microservices.

## Benefits of Splitting the Monolith into Microservices

1. **Scalability:** Microservices architecture allows for better scalability than monolithic architecture. Each microservice can be scaled independently, allowing developers to add more resources to specific services as needed. This approach ensures that the application can handle a large number of users and traffic without slowing down.
    
2. **Agility:** Splitting the monolith into microservices allows for greater agility in software development. With each microservice having its own codebase, developers can work on different services simultaneously, reducing the time required to develop new features and updates. This approach also allows for easier testing and deployment of new services.
    
3. **Resilience:** In a monolithic architecture, a single point of failure can bring down the entire application. However, with microservices, each service is independent, and a failure in one service does not affect the rest of the application. This approach makes the application more resilient and fault-tolerant.
    
4. **Technology Diversity:** Microservices allow developers to use different technologies for different services. This approach ensures that the right technology is used for the right job, resulting in better performance and flexibility.
    

## Challenges of Splitting the Monolith into Microservices

1. **Complexity:** Splitting the monolith into microservices adds complexity to the application. With each microservice having its own codebase, data storage, and APIs, the overall architecture becomes more complex, making it harder to maintain and troubleshoot.
    
2. **Distributed Systems:** Microservices are distributed systems, and this comes with its own set of challenges. Communication between services can be slow and unreliable, and maintaining consistency across services can be a challenge.
    
3. **Increased Overhead:** Microservices architecture requires additional infrastructure, such as load balancers, service registries, and monitoring tools. This increases the overhead of maintaining and operating the application.
    
4. **Testing and Deployment:** With each microservice having its own codebase, testing, and deployment become more complex. Developers need to ensure that each service works correctly and that the integration between services is seamless.
    

# Conclusion

Splitting the monolith into microservices can provide several benefits, such as scalability, agility, resilience, and technology diversity. However, this approach also comes with its own set of challenges, such as increased complexity, distributed systems, increased overhead, and testing and deployment challenges. As with any architectural decision, the decision to split the monolith into microservices should be carefully evaluated based on the specific needs of the application.
