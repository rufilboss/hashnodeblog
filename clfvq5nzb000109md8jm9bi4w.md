Are you tired of dealing with slow, buggy web applications? Do you struggle to find the root cause of performance issues and errors? Look no further than LogIQ, a new open-source tool that can help you analyze and optimize your web applications.

We aim to design **LogIQ** to provide deep insights into your application's performance and behavior, helping you identify issues and improve user experience.

With LogIQ, you should be able to:

* **Monitor your application in real-time:** LogIQ provides a real-time dashboard that displays key metrics such as response times, request rates, and error rates. You can quickly spot trends and issues, and drill down into specific requests for more detailed information.
    
* **Troubleshoot issues with ease:** LogIQ makes it easy to pinpoint the source of errors and performance issues. You can search and filter logs based on various criteria, including time range, severity, and keywords. You can also view detailed request and response logs, allowing you to see exactly what's happening under the hood.
    
* **Optimize your application for speed:** LogIQ provides insights into how your application is performing and where bottlenecks may be. You can use this information to optimize your application for speed and improve overall performance.
    

LogIQ is still in the early stages of development, and we're actively seeking contributors to help us build and improve the tool.
