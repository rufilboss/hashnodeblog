In this blog, I'll be exploring what distributed system is all about in a brief explanation!

### What are distributed systems?

**Distributed systems** refer to a collection of independent computers that work together as a single system. In a distributed system, each computer operates independently and has memory and processing power. However, computers are connected through a communication network, and they coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal.

The main advantage of distributed systems is that they can provide higher reliability and availability than a single computer. Since the system is distributed across multiple computers, if one computer fails, the system can continue to function by switching the workloads to other computers. Additionally, distributed systems can provide higher *performance* and *scalability*, since the workload can be divided among multiple computers.

Some examples of distributed systems include ***cloud computing platforms, social media networks,*** and ***e-commerce websites***. In these systems, multiple computers work together to provide a seamless experience to the end users.

However, designing and building distributed systems can be complex and challenging, as the computers in the system must work together in a coordinated and consistent manner. This requires specialized knowledge and skills, including ***networking*, *security,*** and ***distributed algorithms.***
