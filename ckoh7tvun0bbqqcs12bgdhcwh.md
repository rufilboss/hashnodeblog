1. Don't try to generally learn the code but, pick a ***PROJECT*** you like and try to emulate it.
    
2. Don't be afraid to ask for ***HELP***.
    
3. Have enough confidence to believe in yourself, but enough ***HUMILITY*** to know that you don't know everything.
    
4. Don't be afraid of failure. You won't ***HARM*** or ***KILL*** anyone.
    
5. Treat programming like a new beat. Know where to find the answers to the questions.
