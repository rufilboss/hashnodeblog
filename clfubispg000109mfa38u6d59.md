To those who are transitioning to the tech industry, my advice is this: while it can be overwhelming at times, take your time to learn and avoid rushing things. There's a wealth of knowledge waiting for you, so learn at a pace that suits you and ensure you're part of a supportive community of like-minded individuals. Remember, you don't necessarily need a university degree to excel in tech. Networking with people outside of tech is also crucial, as they can be a great source of refreshment when you're feeling burnt out.

## **Getting started**

One of the advantages of pursuing a career in tech is the vast array of opportunities available. Once you identify the right path, it's all about devising a plan to gain the necessary experience and present yourself effectively to potential employers.

You may know someone who works in tech, whether it be from home or in a casual dress code and appears to be thriving in their role. Despite the relaxed atmosphere, this is not a typical white-collar job, and many tech professionals earn competitive salaries in foreign currencies. Additionally, some have even had the opportunity to travel abroad for work. It's easy to wonder when you might have the same opportunities.

So many people think because of their background, they can't transition into tech or could've heard somewhere that tech being in tech is overwhelming. Whether you are in agriculture, law, medicine, or accounting, you can make a smooth career transition into the tech space. Opportunities abound in spaces like *product management, data science, software engineering, UI/UX, cloud computing, animation, cybersecurity, DevOps,* and many more.

## Some specific steps to take for careers transitioning into tech.

### **Understand what role you want to play in the tech space**

Understanding your strengths and preferences is essential when deciding which area of tech to pursue. This self-knowledge can come from a variety of sources, such as your personality traits, skillset, or prior career experience. For instance, an individual with a background in HR may be drawn to Agile HR Analytics, while someone with an entrepreneurial spirit may thrive in product management. Recognizing your unique qualities and assessing where you currently stand in your career journey can greatly aid in a successful transition to a tech role.

### Choose a career path that aligns with your interests and passions in the tech industry.

If you are a type who's mostly interested in solving problems software/DevOps engineering can be a good fit, or if you are a lover of numbers, you most likely want to be in the data space. If you are the creative type, UI/UX design may be great for you. These are things you need to enjoy. You should either have them as a skill or ensure itâ€™s something you will be interested in learning. If you have no idea about which one to go for, you can reach out to people who are already in the field. Also, check the [developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/) to learn more about some roles.

### **Talk to People Who Are Already in The Space**

Consider scanning your LinkedIn connections and discussing your desired career shift with friends and family. Try to connect with someone who currently holds the job you aspire to and ask if they would be willing to participate in an informational interview. This could help you gain insights into their career path and enable you to contemplate how you can follow in their footsteps to achieve your goals.

### **Start Learning**

You may be able to self-study in your spare time at home and pick up necessary skills using resources like [udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Consider enrolling in tech classes or boot camps, or even reading books that can teach you new skills. If you're interested, you can also explore the *ALX Software Engineering Programme* to start building your tech skills today.

### **Consider Getting a Mentor**

To find a mentor in your desired tech career, consider joining a professional organization and attending events such as networking gatherings and conferences. It's also helpful to introduce yourself to as many tech professionals as possible. A mentor can provide valuable guidance as you transition to your dream career, coaching you through necessary steps and helping you set goals for acquiring skills and finding jobs. They can also facilitate networking with the right people. By widening your network and seeking out a mentor, you'll have the support and advice you need to succeed in your new career path.

### **As you Learn, Practice!!!**

Hands-on experience does not have to come from a full-time, paid position. You also can get it from contributing to open source, volunteer positions, apprenticeships, part-time jobs, and internships. Reach out to companies that could use your assistance while allowing you to learn on the job. Most IT jobs don't offer paid training at the beginning of your employment, but some do. Look into your desired field and see if employer-sponsored training is a possibility.

### **Take Your Next Step**

Assess which skills you've acquired and compare them to the skills listed in job postings. If you're still lacking in any areas, find additional educational resources to help you fill the gaps. Take a free career quiz online to see what tech careers are a good match for the skills you already have. Knowing the right people in the industry who can introduce you to hiring managers when positions open up can benefit your job search considerably. In fact, according to LinkedIn, a [2016 survey](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler/) revealed that 85 percent of job seekers find their jobs through networking. Never doubt the power of expanding your network!
