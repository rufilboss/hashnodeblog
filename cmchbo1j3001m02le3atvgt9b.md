# **Introduction**

**Context**:  
Deploying static websites to AWS S3 is a cost-effective and scalable solution for hosting. Automating this process with GitHub Actions eliminates manual steps and ensures consistency in deployment.

**Problem Statement**:  
Manually uploading files to S3 can be time-consuming and error-prone. As a DevOps Engineer, you need an automated solution to streamline this process.

**Solution**:  
This guide demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your static website to an AWS S3 bucket automatically.

## **Prerequisites**

* **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account with access to S3.
    
* **GitHub Repository**: A repository containing your static website files.
    
* **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured locally for testing.
    
* **GitHub Actions**: Enabled for your repository.
    

## **Step 1: Set Up an S3 Bucket**

* **Create a Bucket**:
    
    1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
        
    2. Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket.
        
    3. Configure bucket settings (e.g., enable public access for static websites).
        
* **Enable Static Website Hosting**:
    
    1. Go to the "Properties" tab.
        
    2. Enable static website hosting and specify the index document (e.g., `index.html`).
        

## **Step 2: Generate AWS Access Keys**

* **Create an IAM User**:
    
    1. Go to the IAM console and create a user with programmatic access.
        
    2. Attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy (or a custom policy with least privilege).
        
* **Save Keys**: Download the access and secret keys for later use.
    

## **Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets**

* **Add Secrets to GitHub**:
    
    1. Go to your GitHub repository.
        
    2. Navigate to **Settings &gt; Secrets and variables &gt; Actions**.
        
    3. Add the following secrets:
        
        * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
            
        * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
            
        * `AWS_REGION`
            
        * `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
            

## **Step 4: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**

* **Define Workflow File**: Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository.
    
* **Sample Workflow Configuration**:
    
    ```yaml
    name: Deploy to S3
    
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
    
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        steps:
          - name: Checkout Code
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
          - name: Configure AWS Credentials
            uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
            with:
              aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
              aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
              aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
    
          - name: Sync Files to S3
            run: |
              aws s3 sync . s3://${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_NAME }} --delete
    ```
    

## **Step 5: Test and Deploy**

* **Push to Main Branch**: Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch.
    
* **Monitor Actions**: Check the GitHub Actions tab to monitor the workflow execution.
    
* **Verify Deployment**: Visit your S3 bucketâ€™s public URL to confirm the website is live.
    

# **Conclusion**

Automating static website deployment to AWS S3 using GitHub Actions simplifies the CI/CD process, saving time and reducing errors. By following this guide, you can ensure efficient and reliable deployments for your projects.
