When setting up a network, one of the most important decisions you'll have to make is whether to use **dynamic** or **static** IP addressing. Both have their advantages and disadvantages and choosing the right one for your network will depend on a variety of factors.

In this blog, I'll take a look at dynamic and static IP addressing, how they work, and the pros and cons of each to help you make an informed decision for your network. If you haven't already done so, please take a look at my earlier post on [IP addressing](https://rufilboy.hashnode.dev/an-introduction-to-ip-addressing).

## **Dynamic IP Addressing**

**Dynamic IP addressing** is a method of assigning IP addresses to devices on a network automatically. This is typically done through a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server, which assigns IP addresses to devices as they join the network. Dynamic IP addressing is widely used in home and small business networks, as it is simple and requires little maintenance.

### **Advantages of Dynamic IP Addressing**

One of the biggest advantages of dynamic IP addressing is its simplicity. With dynamic IP addressing, you don't have to worry about manually assigning IP addresses to devices on your network. This can save time and reduce the potential for errors. Dynamic IP addressing can also help conserve IP address space, as IP addresses are only assigned to devices when they are needed.

Another advantage of dynamic IP addressing is that it can help prevent conflicts between devices on the network. Since IP addresses are assigned automatically, there is less chance of two devices being assigned the same IP address.

### **Disadvantages of Dynamic IP Addressing**

One of the biggest disadvantages of dynamic IP addressing is that IP addresses can change. This can be problematic if you are running services that rely on a specific IP address, such as a web server. If the IP address changes, *clients* may not be able to connect to the *server* until the IP address is updated.

Another disadvantage of dynamic IP addressing is that it can make it more difficult to manage your network. If you have a large number of devices on your network, it can be challenging to keep track of which devices have been assigned which IP addresses.

## **Static IP Addressing**

**Static IP addressing** is a method of assigning IP addresses to devices on a network manually. This is typically done by network administrators or IT professionals who need to have control over which devices are assigned which IP addresses. Static IP addressing is commonly used in larger organizations, where network administrators need to have a greater degree of control over their network.

### **Advantages of Static IP Addressing**

One of the biggest advantages of static IP addressing is that it provides greater control over your network. With static IP addressing, you can manually assign IP addresses to devices on your network, which can help ensure that specific devices always have the same IP address. This can be particularly useful if you are running services that rely on a specific IP address, such as a web server.

Another advantage of static IP addressing is that it can make it easier to manage your network. Since you have control over which devices are assigned IP addresses, you can keep track of which devices are on your network and ensure that they are configured correctly.

### **Disadvantages of Static IP Addressing**

One of the biggest disadvantages of static IP addressing is that it can be time-consuming and difficult to manage. Manually assigning IP addresses to devices on your network requires more effort than dynamic IP addressing, and it can be challenging to keep track of which IP addresses have been assigned to which devices.

Another disadvantage of static IP addressing is that it can lead to conflicts between devices on your network. If two devices are assigned the same IP address, it can cause problems and make it difficult to connect to network resources.

## Conclusion

Choosing between dynamic and static IP addressing will depend on your specific network needs. If you have a small network and don't need a lot of control over IP address assigning a dynamic IP address may be the best option for you. On the other hand, if you have a larger network and need greater control over the IP address assigning a static IP address may be the way to go.

**NOTE:** *Some networks use a combination of both dynamic and static IP addressing. For example, you may use dynamic IP addressing for most devices on your network but assign static IP addresses to critical devices such as servers and network printers.*

Ultimately, the decision to use dynamic or static IP addressing will depend on your specific network needs. By understanding the pros and cons of each, you can make an informed decision that will help you build a more reliable and efficient network.
