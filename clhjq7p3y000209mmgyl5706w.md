It's day 87 of my **#100DaysOfDevOps** challenge, in this blog I'll be writing about what I learned today, it's about how to identify a monolithic architecture and migrate to microservices...

As we've known that monolithic architecture is a traditional approach to building software where the entire application is built as a single, cohesive unit. While this approach can work well for small applications, as systems grow in size and complexity, it can become increasingly difficult to maintain and scale.

Microservices, on the other hand, is a modern approach to building applications where the system is broken down into smaller, more manageable components that can be developed and deployed independently.

If you're working with a monolithic system and are considering migrating to microservices, here's a guide to help you identify monolithic architecture in your system and make the move to microservices.

# A Guide on Migrating from Monolithic Architecture to Microservices

Let's break everything down in steps;

# Step 1: Understand the Monolithic Architecture

The first step is to understand what monolithic architecture is and how it works. In a monolithic system, all components of the application are tightly coupled, and the entire system is deployed as a single unit. This makes it difficult to make changes to the system as a whole and requires developers to redeploy the entire application each time a change is made. This approach can lead to slower development times, increased complexity, and difficulty in scaling.

## Step 2: Evaluate Your System

The next step is to evaluate your system and determine whether it is built using a monolithic architecture. Here are a few key indicators of a monolithic system:

* *The entire application is deployed as a single unit*
    
* *Changes to one component of the system require the redeployment of the entire application*
    
* *The application has a single codebase and database*
    
* *The application has a single deployment pipeline*
    

If any of these indicators are present in your system, then it's likely that you are working with a monolithic architecture.

## Step 3: Identify Services

Once you've identified that your system is built using a monolithic architecture, the next step is to identify the individual services that make up your application. This involves breaking down your application into smaller, more manageable components that can be developed and deployed independently. This process can be challenging, especially if you're dealing with a large, complex system. However, it's an essential step in the migration process, as it will help you understand how your system is currently structured and how it can be broken down into smaller components.

## Step 4: Create a Roadmap

With a clear understanding of your system's architecture and identified services, the next step is to create a roadmap for migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices. This roadmap should include a detailed plan for how you will break down your application into smaller, more manageable components, as well as how you will deploy and manage those components once they are developed.

## Step 5: Develop and Deploy Services

Once you've created a roadmap, it's time to start developing and deploying your services. This process can take time and requires careful planning and coordination. It's essential to ensure that each service is developed and deployed independently and that there is clear communication and coordination between teams.

## Step 6: Monitor and Optimize

As you begin to deploy your services, it's essential to monitor and optimize their performance. This involves tracking metrics such as response time, error rates, and resource utilization to ensure that your system is performing as expected. It's also important to continuously optimize your system by identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement and making the necessary changes to improve performance and scalability.

# Conclusion

So in the end, migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices is a complex process that requires careful planning, coordination, and execution. By understanding your system's architecture, breaking down your application into smaller components, and developing and deploying services independently, you can successfully migrate to microservices and improve the scalability, performance, and maintainability of your system.
