This error message indicates that the `git pull` command was not able to complete a fast-forward merge of the changes in the remote branch into your local branch.

This can happen when there are conflicting changes between the remote branch and your local branch. In this case, Git cannot automatically merge the changes and you need to resolve the conflicts manually.

**You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:**

1. Use the command `git status` to see the status of your local branch and any changes that have not been committed yet.
    
2. If you have any uncommitted changes, commit them using `git add` and `git commit` before proceeding.
    
3. Use the command `git fetch` to download the latest changes from the remote branch.
    
4. Use the command `git merge origin/<remote-branch-name>` to merge the changes from the remote branch into your local branch.
    
5. If there are any conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually. Use a text editor to open the affected files, resolve the conflicts, and save the changes.
    
6. Once you have resolved all conflicts, use `git add` to stage the changes and `git commit` to commit the merge.
    
7. Finally, use `git push` to push the changes to the remote branch.
    

If you are still having trouble, you can try creating a new branch from the remote branch using `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> origin/<remote-branch-name>` and then merging the new branch into your local branch.
