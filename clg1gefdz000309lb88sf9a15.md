**DevOps** is a software development methodology that has gained a lot of popularity in recent years. It is a combination of Development and Operations and is aimed at bridging the gap between these two teams to deliver software faster and with higher quality. However, for someone new to the concept of DevOps, it can be a bit overwhelming to understand where to start and how to go about it. In this article, we will provide a complete roadmap for DevOps for dummies.

# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a methodology that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation between software development and IT operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to deliver software quickly, reliably, and with high quality. DevOps teams work together to build, test, and deploy software in a continuous manner, using tools and processes that automate much of the work involved.

## Why DevOps?

The traditional software development approach involved long development cycles, manual testing, and deployment processes that could take weeks or even months. This approach was slow and often resulted in delays, errors, and bugs. ***DevOps*** addresses these challenges by breaking down the silos between development and operations teams and introducing automation to speed up the process.

## DevOps Roadmap for Dummies

**Here is a step-by-step roadmap for someone new to DevOps:**

### Understand the DevOps Philosophy

The first step in the DevOps journey is to understand the philosophy behind it. DevOps is not just about using tools and processes to speed up software delivery. It is a cultural shift that requires collaboration, communication, and a focus on continuous improvement. DevOps teams need to be willing to work together, share knowledge, and continuously learn from each other.

### Learn the Basics of Software Development

While DevOps is a methodology for software delivery, it is important to have a basic understanding of software development. This includes programming languages, software design patterns, and software development methodologies such as Agile and Scrum. Knowing the basics of software development will help you understand how DevOps fits into the overall software development lifecycle.

### Familiarize Yourself with DevOps Tools and Technologies

There are several tools and technologies that are commonly used in DevOps.

Familiarizing yourself with these tools and technologies will help you understand how they are used in a DevOps environment.

### Learn About Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing IT infrastructure that involves defining infrastructure using code. This allows for infrastructure to be versioned, tested, and deployed in a repeatable and automated manner. There are a number of IaC tools that are commonly used in DevOps, including Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible. Learning about IaC will help you understand how to manage infrastructure in a DevOps environment.

### Learn About Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Cloud computing has become an important part of DevOps, as it allows for the rapid provisioning of infrastructure and the scaling of resources as needed. There are several cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Learning about cloud computing will help you understand how to build and deploy applications in a cloud environment.

### Learn About Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are critical components of a DevOps environment. Monitoring allows for the continuous monitoring of application performance and infrastructure health, while logging allows for the collection and analysis of log data. There are several monitoring and logging tools that are commonly used in DevOps, including Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Splunk. Learning about monitoring and logging will help you understand how to track the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure.

**PS:** *I would like to bring your attention to a new open-source community called FreeOps that I recently started. The primary objective of this community is to create DevOps tools that are open-source. The first tool that we will be creating is a monitoring and logging tool.
